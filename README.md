## How to play
You can access the "select level page" by clicking on the play button. Then, you can choose between 3 different difficulties: pacific, normal, and difficult.
Next, you can play the actual game, which is a clicker that involves hitting your enemies with the left click of the mouse. You can also multiply your points using a multiplier in the upper-left part of the screen.

## Try to achieve the highest score possible and surpass yourself, but be careful not to let your score drop below 0 or you will lose!
